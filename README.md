# CF_conventions_notes

Notes / comments on the CF conventions

Assorted notes, etc about the CF conventions.

I'm using this as a place to put stuff that I'm working on, so that it's easier to share with others.

Some of this might make its way into the convention somehow, or might turn into a useful public document. But for now -- it's just random notes, thoughts, and experimental code.
